# FAAM-dataset
Optical Music Recognition dataset for handwritten annotations in music scores of the long 19th century.

This is an OMR dataset for spotting, classification and semantic recognition of musical scores with handwritten annotations made by musicians.

We are planning to present the results of our research ad digitization effort to the upcoming ISMIR 2024 conference.
